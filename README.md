# R Education Course Notes
Hello! Attached in this document are my R lecture notes, which I used to teach my R course for both Hoyalytics and Georgetown Baseball. These lectures require no prerequisites and are meant to introduce people to R programming, basic statistical principles, and data ethics. Feel free to review the content below! The lecture notes are provided in **PDF** format, along with their reproducible **R and R Markdown** files.

### [Lecture 1 - Intro to R/RStudio](Lecture%201/)
This lecture starts with an inspirational TED Talk introducing the concept of big data, which leads to a discussion on its impact and implications for technology and society. I then take my peers through a tour of the RStudio IDE and finish the lecture with building a simple die roll simulation program.

### [Lecture 2 - Data Structures](Lecture%202/)
This lecture is an overview of data structures and operators in R. I made the choice to teach this before modeling so that my peers could understand the inner workings of the language before they start to build models. This way, building and debugging would be a lot easier!

### [Lectures 3 + 4 - Basic Linear Modeling](Lecture%203%20(and%204)/)
Before introducing my peers to basic linear modeling (simple and multiple linear regression),  this two-part lecture begins with a discussion surrounding data ethics, using Cambridge Analyticaâ€™s role in the 2016 election as a case study. This lecture then walks people through building and evaluating fantasy football projection models from weekly player performance averages. Data visualization techniques using ggplot are also briefly introduced.

### [Lecture 5 - Functional Programming](Lecture%205/)
This lecture introduces the concept of user-defined functions in R, which will help my peers write cleaner code and build more advanced programs. Looping is also introduced as a concept for people to learn repeatable procedures.

### [Lecture 6 - Statistical Hypothesis Testing](Lecture%206/)
My personal favorite, this lecture provides an overview of statistical hypothesis testing so that my peers can understand and verify results. Visual aids using ggplot assist people in exploring distributions and understanding reasons for statistical significance. 

### [Extra Resources and GitHub](Extra%20Resources%20and%20GitHub.pdf)
These are resources I shared with my peers to fill the gaps not covered in lecture. I also give a brief introduction to GitHub and walk people through how to use it for uploading their files.
